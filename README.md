# iOS App: Pokemon Backpack
## ‚ÄúGotta catch them all‚Äù 

¬°Hola mundo!

I was presented with the Challenge of builing a Pokemon Backpack. For me this is almost a full cycle as when I was taking my first steps into developing [I did a Pokedex calling a JSON in React](https://github.com/silviaespanagil/make-your-pokedex). But now I'm using the [Pok√©Api](https://pokeapi.co/) and changed React for Swift. 

This Swift app uses Combine to manage API calls in order to get a random Pok√©mon for each call. One the Pok√©mon trainer finds a Pok√©mon that is worth to catch, it can tap on the Pok√©ball just to save the Pok√©mon into its backpack. All catched Pok√©mons are stored in a Coredata Database and are displayed in the Backpack View. Here, the trainer can see all the catched Pok√©mons sorted by Id, and clicking on them will show a detailed information that includes the Poketype and the date it was catched.

## Initial Requirements üìã

- The app does not show Pok√©mons at start
- To search a Pok√©mon a random number between 1 and 1000 should be generated.
- Show the Pok√©mon in the screen showing name, weight and height as text, and sprite/front_default as image.
- You must be able to catch a Pok√©mon or leave it.
- If a Pok√©mon was already caught you can't catch it again and a message to the trainer should be shown.
- Catched Pok√©mons should get added to the backpack
- The Pok√©mons should be in the backpack forever so they must be there any time you start the app.
- The Backpack should show only image and name of the catched Pok√©mons sorted by Id
- Inform the trainer if there's any error 
- If you click on a catched Pok√©mon a detail should be displayed with the following information:
  * The *name* as text
  * The *sprintes/front_default* as image
  * The date and time when the Pokemon was catched
  * The *weight* as text
  * The *height* as text
  * The *base_experience* as text
  * The types of the Pokemon

## Development ‚å®Ô∏è
 
### API call üìû 
I worked with Combine to manage the API call. As one of the requirements was to generate a random number to make the call and retrieve a random Pok√©mon, I decided to create and id constant which value is an `Int.random(in: 1..<1000)` inside the `getPokemonEndpoint()` method. This way, everytime a Pok√©mon is asked for, the number generates and get into the endpoint.

### Pokeworld view üó∫Ô∏è
The Pok√©mons get via the API are rendered here. This view is empty at the beginning and shows a Gameboy Button to make the first search. Each Pok√©mon you encounter will be shown here and can be catched clicking on the Pok√©ball.

### Persistance ‚òÅÔ∏è
So, you found an amazing Pok√©mon in the Pokeworld an catched it, then, here comes Persistance. I created a Database using CoreData with three methods, one to catch the Pok√©mon, one for checking is not already catched and the last one is for retrieving all the catched Pok√©mons to see them later in the Backpack.

So with `savePok√©mon(pokemon: Pokemon)` I save the Pok√©mon you just caught in the Database. The `existPokemon(pokemon: Pokemon)-> Bool` is a method that returns a Boolean and checks if a Pok√©mon that is showns on the Pokeworld was already caught. This is important because, if the Pok√©mon you find in the world, was already caught, you won't be able to catch it again because...is already yours! Last but no least the `getCatchedPokemons() -> [Pokemon]` method that returns an array with all the Pok√©mons you have caught to check them in your Backpack.

### Backpack üéí
As a proud trainer you want to see all Pokem√≥ns you have found and caught so, they are all here waitting in the Backpack. This view shows a grid with a simplified card that only shows the picture and name of the Pok√©mon. But, if you click on any card you will be able to see detailed information and the date you have caught it.

### User feedback üí¨
We want the user to understand some things that happen while using the app. So there are some features that are user centered that gives the user feedback about their actions or the app. 
   * **Help tool:** The toolbar has a little help button. Is your first time using the app? No problem! check it and learn how to use it. 
   * **Failed API call:** We all know nothing is perfect so, if in any moment while retrieving a Pok√©mon from the API the call fail, a message appears and the user can try catching a new Pok√©mon.
   * **Catching Pok√©mons:** If while looking for new Pok√©mons the user finds a creature that is already caught, a toast message appears letting it know the Pok√©mon is already caught and the Pokeball button in disabled and blured. And if the user find a new Pok√©mon and decides to catch it, a Gotcha! toast message will appear just to confirm them it was correctly caught.

### States üö¶
The views are loaded using states: empty, loading, loaded and for the Pokeworld also failed. Each one of this states update the view content as expected. For the empty view I show a welcome message and Gameboy search button in the Pokeworld and an empty backpack in the Backpack View. This views have information so the user can keep interacting with the app.
The loading state renders an animated Pokeball with a searching message. The loaded view updates content to render the expected and sucessful view and the failed view, as stated before on this readme, shows a customize error message with the search button.

### Testing ‚úÖ
I know this works not only because it builds on the simulator but because is tested: remote and local tests passed.
